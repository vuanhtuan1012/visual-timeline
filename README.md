# Visual Timeline
This project is to create six advanced video players with a visual navigation panel based on built-in video player in HTML5.
* [Advanced Video Player](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/AdvancedVideoPlayer.html)
This is a simplest video player among these players. The visual navigation panel contains keyframe at every 2 seconds.
* In three video players [Select Key Frames](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/SelectKeyframes.html), [Drag & Drop](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/DragDrop.html) and [Content-Based](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/content-based/ContentBased.html), alternative methods for contructing key frames are applied.  
 * In [Select Key Frames video player](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/SelectKeyframes.html), key frames in navigation panel are chosen by user. He plays video and clicks on "Select Frame" button to choose current frame as a key frame.
 * In the [Drag & Drop video player](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/DragDrop.html), user drag & drop a frame into navigation panel to create a key frame.
 * In the [Content-Based video player](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/content-based/ContentBased.html), key frames in the navigation panel are chosen based on a content-based method. A key frame is chosen if it is significantly different from the previous one. The Euclidean distance is used to compare two key frames. A threshold value is introduced to determine whether the difference between two consecutive frames is larger enough or not.
* Alternative navigation panels are introduced in two last video players, [Slider](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/Slider.html) and [Multiresolution](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/visual-timeline/blob/master/Multiresolution.html) video players.
